Usage
-----

Only one param is required:

~~~bash
manga-downloader [URL]
~~~

The URL must be a series index file (not an individual chapter).

When only specifying the URL, it would ask you if you want to download all
chapters.

> Note: you must specify <kbd>y</kbd> in order to download them, its default
> behavior is set to "no".

You can also specify the range beforehand, the range allows you setting pages by
ranges (i.e. 1,3,5-10):

~~~bash
manga-downloader https://inmanga.com/ver/manga/One-Piece/dfc7ecb5-e9b3-4aa5-a61b-a498993cd935 1-50
# This would download One Piece chapters 1 to 50 into our current folder
~~~

In some sites, like mangadex, it may find multiple results for the same chapter,
given the different languages it's translated to. In these cases, every
coincidence will be downloaded into different files, but you can force a single
language to be downloaded by using `--language`:

~~~bash
manga-downloader --language es https://mangadex.org/title/a1c7c817-4e59-43b7-9365-09675a149a6f/one-piece 1-10
# would download One Piece chapters 1 to 10 in spanish
~~~

Arguments and params are not positional, you can use them in any order:

~~~bash
manga-downloader 1-10 https://mangadex.org/title/a1c7c817-4e59-43b7-9365-09675a149a6f/one-piece --language es
# exactly the same as the previous example, only changing params order
~~~

### Bundling

You can bundle all the downloaded chapters into a single file by using the
`--bundle` arg:

~~~bash
manga-downloader https://inmanga.com/ver/manga/One-Piece/dfc7ecb5-e9b3-4aa5-a61b-a498993cd935 1-8 --bundle
# would download one piece chapters 1 to 8 and bundle them into a single file
~~~

~~~

Installation
------------

First download your desired version from the [releases section][releases].

After you downloaded and unarchived it, you can start using it in that folder:

~~~bash
./manga-downloader URL range
~~~

For Windows users would be:

~~~cmd
.\manga-downloader URL range
~~~

If you want the binary to be accessible from your terminal in whatever path you
might be, you should ensure to place the binary on a `PATH` defined folder (or
add the folder where you downloaded manga-downloader to your `PATH` env var).

Places where you can put the binary and have it accessible system-wide:

- Linux and Mac: `/usr/local/bin`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32`

### Windows

So if you're a windows user and place the .exe file inside `C:\Windows\System32`
you'll be able to call the program wherever you want from:

~~~bash
C:\Users\elboletaire\Desktop>manga-downloader https://mangadex.org/title/e7eabe96-aa17-476f-b431-2497d5e9d060/black-clover 1-346
~~~

The above command would download Black Clover chapters 1 to 346 to the Desktop
folder (since that's the current directory).

### Mac

Mac users will need to either add the binary to the unsigned apps whitelist, or
entirely disable Gatekeeper:

~~~bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
~~~

Othwerise you'll see an error because the binary is unsigned.
